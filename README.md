# Protein Structure Classification 🧬  
UTD Biotech Club – Mini Project Workshop (Fall 2025)

## 🧠 Overview
This project aims to train ML models to classify protein structures (enzyme, membrane protein, etc.) using structural and experimental metadata.  
It’s part of a 5-week workshop focused on learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📅 Progress Log
### Week 1 – Data Cleaning & Visualization
- Loaded dataset and inspected columns using pandas
- Handled missing values
- Created histograms for residue count, resolution, and publication year trends
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap
- Learned why features like resolution and residue count matter in protein crystallography

### Upcoming Weeks
- **Week 2:** Feature encoding and normalization  
- **Week 3:** Model training and evaluation  
- **Week 4:** Hyperparameter tuning and pipeline building  
- **Week 5:** Final presentation and app demo  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab
